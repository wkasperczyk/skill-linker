## Core Idea
Testing in this project is divided into tool-level tests and full workflow integration tests. Use the provided npm scripts for rapid validation.

## Key Points
- **Tool Tests**: Validate individual tools in isolation (e.g., `npm run test:playbook`).
- **Workflow Tests**: Run full end-to-end scenarios (e.g., `npm run test:workflow`).
- **Baseline Tests**: Compare current performance against a known baseline (`npm run test:baseline`).
- **Observability**: Use `npm run traces` after tests to inspect the execution details in the database.

## Quick Example
```bash
# Test a specific tool
npm run test:calculator

# Run full validity workflow
npm run validity:workflow

# View results of the last run
npm run traces
```
